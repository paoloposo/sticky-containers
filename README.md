# Sticky Containers

This jQuery plugin adds a wrapper for [Leafo's Sticky-kit](https://github.com/leafo/sticky-kit) for easier sticking in column-oriented layouts. It is compatible with the Bootstrap grid system, but doesn't require it.

## Installation

This plugin requires jQuery and [Leafo's Sticky-kit](https://github.com/leafo/sticky-kit).

## Usage

With Sticky-kit, you would select one or more elements and tell them to stick in their parent element.
With Sticky Containers, you select the parent (a row) and tell it which of its children (the containers) should stick in it.

	$('#my-row').sticky_containers(options);
